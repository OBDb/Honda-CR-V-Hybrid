generations:
  - name: "First Generation (Fifth-generation CR-V platform)"
    start_year: 2017
    end_year: 2022
    description: "The original CR-V Hybrid was based on the fifth-generation CR-V platform, representing Honda's first electrified SUV in many markets. Featuring the same exterior design as the standard CR-V with subtle hybrid badging and blue-accented Honda emblems, it combined a 2.0L Atkinson-cycle four-cylinder engine with two electric motors for a combined output of approximately 212 HP (varying slightly by market). Unlike many hybrid systems that use a conventional transmission, Honda's Intelligent Multi-Mode Drive (i-MMD) used a single fixed gear ratio for most driving conditions, with the electric motor providing primary propulsion and the engine acting either as a generator or providing direct drive at higher speeds. The interior was nearly identical to the standard CR-V with hybrid-specific displays in the instrument cluster to monitor power flow and efficiency. Available in front-wheel drive in some markets and standard all-wheel drive in others, it delivered significantly improved fuel economy over the conventional models, typically achieving around 40 mpg in combined driving. This generation established the CR-V Hybrid as an efficient alternative within Honda's bestselling SUV lineup, though its introduction timing varied considerably by region, arriving first in Europe and Asia before later expansion to North America for the 2020 model year."

  - name: "Second Generation (Sixth-generation CR-V platform)"
    start_year: 2023
    end_year: null
    description: "The current CR-V Hybrid is built on the sixth-generation CR-V platform, featuring the same more rugged exterior styling with a longer hood, upright grille, and stronger horizontal elements. The hybrid powertrain has been significantly enhanced, now combining a refined 2.0L Atkinson-cycle four-cylinder engine with a more powerful electric motor system for a combined output of 204 HP and 247 lb-ft of torqueâ€”positioning it as the performance option in the CR-V lineup rather than just the efficiency choice. Honda's improved fourth-generation hybrid system (still using the i-MMD architecture) offers more refined operation and stronger acceleration while maintaining excellent fuel economy rated at 40 mpg combined in AWD form. The interior matches the upscale improvements of the standard sixth-generation CR-V, featuring a horizontal dashboard design with a standard 7-inch touchscreen (9-inch available) and 7-inch digital instrument display, though with hybrid-specific information screens. Unlike the previous generation where the hybrid was a niche variant, this generation positions the hybrid as a core part of the lineup, available in multiple trim levels and expected to comprise approximately 50% of CR-V sales as Honda accelerates its electrification strategy. All CR-V Hybrid models now come standard with all-wheel drive in North America, enhancing its appeal in all-weather conditions. This generation represents Honda's commitment to hybrid technology as a bridge toward full electrification, offering a no-compromise option that improves both performance and efficiency over the standard turbocharged model."
